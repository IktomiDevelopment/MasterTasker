# MasterTasker
This application is written using JQuery Mobile.
It currently DOES NOT have the SQL file for the database creation (though I will have that uploaded soon). If you would like the file before I get it uploaded just shoot an email to danny@dewdevelopment.com and I'll send it to you
This application is simply to allow a superior to give tasks and track the completion of those tasks of a subordinate. It allows someone to be a superior of a person that is a subordinate in one project and have switched roles in a different project.
The JQuery Mobile code is included however it is probably better to link to the proper updated version at JQuery than to use what's here. I have it here for anyone that may want to turn it into a hybrid mobile app.
If you have any questions feel free to send an email and ask.
